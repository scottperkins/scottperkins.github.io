    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the <a class="hreflink link clickable-link" href="https://physics.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, I work under <a class="hreflink link clickable-link" href="https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/nyunes" traget="_blank">Dr. Nicolas Yunes</a> in the <a class="hreflink link clickable-link" href="https://relativity.physics.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">relativity group</a> researching how general relativity, our best theory of gravitational interaction to date, can be extended to try and solve some of physics' long standing problems. By altering the fundamental nature of how bodies interact gravitationally, solutions might be found that can address issues like the expansion of the universe or might help us bridge the gap between our best theory of microscopic systems, quantum mechanics.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While plenty of theories aim to solve some of these issues in physics, only theories that are consistent with observable data are relevant. Experiments that can actually test these types of theories at the required energy scales are only highly relativistic, astrophysical systems. Observations are focused on binary neutron stars and binary black holes. The enormous amounts of energy released by these inspiralling and colliding bodies allows us to look for tell-tale signs of these extensions to general relativity. These signals come both in the form of electromagnetic radiations (seen by conventional telescopes) and through gravitational waves (seen by new detectors like <a class="hreflink llink clickable-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> and <a class="hreflink llink clickable-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu/">Virgo</a>). My research focuses on the latter, sifting through gravitational wave data looking for evidence of new physics.

      Extending general relativity to higher energy systems has been a persistent problem in physics, and one way to expand the range of GR is to introduce "higher curvature" terms to the action. This effectively means we are treating GR as the first term in some expansion, and we expect there to be more terms in the series. To try to constrain these "higher-curvature" theories, our team analyzed data from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration and placed 90% confidence intervals on the coupling parameter of the theory. This parameter is just a way of defining the strength of the modification, and our constraints therefore put a bound on how large a modification of this type can be.

      One reason to try to look for a gravitational theory beyond general relativity is to try and explain why the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. There are a variety of explanations for this currently, but they all come with their own sets of issues. One solution may be that gravity works differently on cosmological scales, which might come about as the result of adding additional fields. The problem with this track of thinking is that we have exquisitely tight constraints on how gravity works on the level of the solar system, so adding a field that can cause the accelerated expansion of the universe inevitably violates these bounds. Recently however, a mechanism to hide deviations from GR in local regions of space but allows large deviations in inter-galactic space has seen a resurgence in the literature. In this paper, we put a constraint on the effective mass of the graviton coming about by this hypothetical, additional field while including this more nuanced effect.
