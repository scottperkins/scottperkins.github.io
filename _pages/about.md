I'm a physicist focused on data analysis in observational astronomy (both [gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/gravitational-waves) and optical surveys). I'm generally interested in problems related to inference, uncertainty quantification, and general optimization, especially as they relate to physics and astrophysics.

Please reach out with questions, comments or ideas for research!
