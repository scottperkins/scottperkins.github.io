I grew up in Arlington, Texas. For my undergraduate degree, I spent four years at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, where I graduated with a B.S. in physics with minors in mathematics and astrophysics. I moved north after graduating, spending two years in Bozeman, Montana. Here, I received my M.Sc. degree in physics from Montana State University. After receiving my master's degree, I followed my advisor, Dr. Nicolas Yunes, to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I defended my doctoral dissertation in April of 2022.

At UIUC, I was a graduate fellow through the Center for AstroPhysical Surveys and National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and I studied possible extensions to general relativity in an effort to answer some long-standing questions in physics. To do this, we utilize the latest data from collaborations like LIGO/Virgo to determine what modifications to general relativity are consistent with observation. To attempt to forecast future science in the field and to better prepare the community with the best models possible, we also do extensive modeling of gravitational wave systems.
