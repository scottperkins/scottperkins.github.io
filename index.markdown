# Research Interests

In graduate school, I wrote my [doctoral thesis](/assets/doctoral_thesis_Perkins_Scott.pdf) about the use of the recently detected phenomena of [gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw) to inform our understanding of fundamental physics.

My work has revolved around the nuanced problem of extracting information from these signals, usually requiring discrete sampling of the ~15 dimensional parameter space of our models.
