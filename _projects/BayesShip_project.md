Almost all modern fields of physics and astrophysics revolve around extracting information from noisy and/or large data sets. 
A popular method of extracting this information is through direct sampling, from algorithms like [Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](/blog/2022/markov-chain-monte-carlo/) and [Reversible Jump MCMC (RJMCMC)](/blog/2022/rj-markov-chain-monte-carlo/). 
This type of analysis was foundational in my dissertation, in which I applied these techniques to gravitational wave data.

The power of these techniques became very apparent, and I generalized my software to a broader class of problems.
